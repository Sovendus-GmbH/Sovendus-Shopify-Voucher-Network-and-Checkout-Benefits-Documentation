## Create discount codes in bulk

If you use the Voucher Network, it's recommended to use a tool to create voucher codes in bulk \
You can use for example [Bulk Discounts](https://apps.shopify.com/bulk-discounts) to create multiple discount codes at once

## Add Sovendus script

1. Copy the Shopify script from [here](https://github.com/Sovendus-GmbH/Sovendus-Shopify-Voucher-Network-and-Checkout-Benefits-Documentation/blob/main/shopify.template.html) and replace YOUR_SOURCE_NUMBER and YOUR_MEDIUM_NUMBER with the one we provide you in your integration documentation. Make sure to use the right country code. If you are using sovendus for multiple countries, make sure you define YOUR_SOURCE_NUMBER and YOUR_MEDIUM_NUMBER in the script as well.
2. In your Shopify backend go to: Settings -> Checkout -> Order status page -> Additional scripts - paste the script and save it.
